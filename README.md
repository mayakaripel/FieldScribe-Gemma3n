# FieldScribe: A Multimodal AI Co-Pilot for Farmers

### üèÜ Official Submission for the Google Gemma 3n Impact Challenge üèÜ

---

## Project Overview

FieldScribe is a multimodal diagnostic tool designed to empower farmers in low-connectivity areas, especially those with communication barriers. By combining image recognition, speech-to-text, and advanced language understanding, FieldScribe acts as an expert co-pilot, helping farmers identify crop diseases right in the field.

The project fulfills the "Gemma 3n" vision by building a functional, high-impact application that is "bigger than a simple chatbot." I used Google's **PaliGemma** as the core "eyes and brain" of the system and **OpenAI's Whisper** to provide audio understanding.

## üí° How It Works

The pipeline, demonstrated in the Kaggle Notebook, proves a true multimodal workflow:
1.  **See:** A farmer uploads a photo of a diseased plant.
2.  **Hear:** The farmer records their observations in their own voice.
3.  **Understand:** FieldScribe uses Whisper to transcribe the audio, combining it with the image and a text prompt.
4.  **Analyze:** Google's PaliGemma model processes all three inputs simultaneously to provide a clear, actionable diagnosis.
