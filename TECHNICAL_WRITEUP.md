For millions of farmers, distance and communication are the hardest barriers to getting help. How do you describe a complex plant disease when you're miles from an expert and can't find the words?
This is the problem i set out to solve for the Google Gemma 3n Impact Challenge. The project, FieldScribe, is an AI co-pilot that gives a voice to every farmer. It uses multimodal AI to see what they see (through an image) and hear what they say (through a voice note) to provide instant, expert-level analysis.
